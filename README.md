# Thompson-sampling
Implementation of Thompson sampling in a multi-armed bandit problem. We run $n=200$ iterations of Thompson sampler using a Beta(1,1) prior with a Bernoulli distribution as likelihood. The implemenation also includes a animation of the sampled distributions, see Thompson_sampler.gif.
